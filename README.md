Our entry for [Ludum Dare 51](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/machine-yearning).

You are a robot applying for a job.  The poster of the job wants to keep humans from applying.  To do this, they have prepared a captcha system with a new captcha _every 10 seconds_ that only robots should be able to solve.  Can you keep track of the language you're building, or will your tiny human brain collapse under its own weight?

**Play the game [here](https://welldweller.github.io/machine-yearning/).**

## Hints

It might be nice to figure this out on your own, but if you're getting frustrated: during some rounds, _you're_ defining what the colors and symbols mean.  Just make sure you can remember them for future rounds in order to prove you're a robot!
